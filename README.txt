# Autonomous EV Charger Project Documentation

## Overview
This shared drive contains all the essential documentation for the Autonomous EV Charger Project conducted during our second year as part of the Praxis III course. The project aimed to create a system capable of autonomously detecting a charging port on an electric vehicle and connecting the charger within a set environment.

## Contents
- `Project Management/`: Snapshot of our project management board detailing our workflow, tasks breakdown, and progress tracking.
- `Electrical/Photos/`: Contains photographs of the actual wiring setups and the wiring diagrams, providing a visual representation of the electrical system of our prototype.
- `Mechanical/Photos/`: A collection of CAD design files and real-world photographs showcasing the mechanical components and their assembly.
- `Programming/Photos/`: Screenshots of the Arduino code developed for the computer vision component of the project, which played a critical role in detecting the charging port.

## Structure
Each folder in this drive is organized to reflect the various aspects of the design process:
- **Project Management**: Follow our journey from the initial brainstorming sessions to the completion of each milestone, including our responses to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Electrical Design**: Dive into the circuit designs and understand the intricacies of the system's power distribution and control logic.
- **Mechanical Design**: Explore the mechanical ingenuity that went into ensuring the physical components met the project's requirements for precision and functionality.
- **Software Development**: Peek into the algorithms that drove the autonomous navigation and decision-making processes of the prototype.

## Usage
The documentation provided in this drive serves as an archive of our work and is intended for educational purposes. It offers insight into the practical application of interdisciplinary engineering skills to solve real-world challenges.

## Note
As the project was unfortunately cut before Milestone 3 due to unforeseen circumstances, the final design is not provided. However, the available materials still offer a comprehensive view of the project's development stages.

Thank you for exploring our project. We hope these documents inspire and guide future endeavors in autonomous systems and mechatronics.
